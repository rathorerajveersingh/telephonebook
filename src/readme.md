# ☎️ Console-Based Telephone Book (Java)

This is my **third Java project**, a simple **console-based Telephone Book** application. It allows users to add, search, update, and delete contacts — all through an easy-to-use command-line interface.

This project helped me strengthen my skills in Java collections, file handling (if implemented), and CRUD operations.
